# octavia-to-tf-migration

This is a helper script to convert our bunch of Octavia YML configuration to Terraform

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ 
This is quick script to be thrown away in a few weeks at the end of the migration, so there is quickly done, with quick win, quick hacks.

So we don't thrive for high quality of production.

However as it might interest persons of Airbyte community, we share it quickly here.
